                        <h2>Investment Consultation and Management</h2>
                        <p>Thoroughbred National focuses on achieving favorable long-term returns by investing in companies with strong fundamentals and excellent management, trading well below our approximation of intrinsic value. We concentrate our portfolio in businesses we understand and intend on holding over the long-term.</p>

                        <h2>Investment Principles</h2>
                        <p>We maintain strict investment criteria, and many stars must align for us to allocate client capital. We will not invest unless we understand the business, its competitors, and industry well. Generally we prefer businesses with a durable economic advantage, strong management, and a high return on equity with manageable debt. We study many companies but choose to own only our best ideas when offered reasonable prices, and will turn down far more opportunities than we select. We seek companies where managers are shareholders and act like owners.</p>

                        <h2>Disciplined Exection</h2>
                        <p>We only purchase securities we believe to be trading well below their intrinsic value, and will opportunistically exit investments when offered a price well beyond their current or near-term future value. We may also exit positions early if a more attractive opportunity arises. When no companies meet our investment criteria, we will hold cash until one inevitably does. Our highest priority is the preservation of our clients' capital.</p>

                        <p>We build all investment positions with a margin of safety; we will ignore short term price gyrations, and instead follow the development of the underlying fundamentals. When a company with an excellent management culture continues to perform well and remains fairly valued, we will remain proud owners and allow them to compound for many years.</p>
